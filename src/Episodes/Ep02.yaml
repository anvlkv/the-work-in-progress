02/01/55.mp4:
  446:
    tts:
      - seeking sounds like hell
  2613:
    tts:
      - but the actual API response sounds fine
02/01/56.mp4:
  892:
    tts:
      - let us try using just that
02/01/57.mp4:
02/01/58.mp4:
  96:
    tts:
      - suppose the text for an episode could look like this
  2279:
    tts:
      - add a sequence for every step of presentation
02/01/59.mp4:
02/01/60.mp4:
02/01/61.mp4:
  2597:

      - now
02/01/62.mp4:
  48:
    tts:

02/01/63.mp4:
02/01/64.mp4:

    tts:
      - suppose I want to make a ton of these
      - let us make it generic
  2966:
    tts:
      - in general it needs this
  3458:
    tts:
      - need to offset every next sequence by elapsed frames
  4047:
    tts:
      - and what will vary?
      - the text to speech
  4270:
    tts:
      - and the visible text
02/01/77.mp4:
  669:
    tts:
      - and increase the elapsed frame count
  2820:
    tts:
      - the estimate gets better with every time
  4143:
    tts:
      - well I wonder if I can get it from the API
02/01/78.mp4:
  2502:
    tts:
      - a slightly better estimate
      - one day I make it right
  3824:
    tts:
      - let us turn the text to speech argument into SSML string
02/01/79.mp4:
  2071:
    tts:
      - assume a break after every sentence
02/01/80.mp4:
  813:
    tts:
      - and use the text argument for presentation text
  1976:
    tts:
      - let us say that the script will look
  2534:
    tts:
      - something like this
  3569:
    tts:
      - with the text to speech
  4143:
    tts:
      - as strings please
02/01/81.mp4:
  621:
    tts:
      - do the same with the other ones
02/01/82.mp4:
  2900:
    tts:
      - remove this marvel
  3043:
    tts:
      - simply map the script entries
  3681:
    tts:
      - I need a way to know what did it estimate in total
  4175:
    tts:
      - only it has to be an object not separate arguments
02/01/83.mp4:
02/01/84.mp4:
  1801:
    tts:
      - 1
      - nope
  2167:
    tts:
      - .5
      - seems adding breaks in from of speech does not make sense to the open tts
  3171:
    tts:
      - seems better now
      - only my console log is in a wrong place
  3617:
    tts:
      - move it
  3936:
    tts:
      - right here
  4191:
    tts:
      - so the trailer will take two thousand three hundred fourteen frames
02/01/85.mp4:
  32:
    tts:
      - set it here
  2103:
    tts:
      - suppose it does it, only I need to remove all the dots from my text to speech as it actually says the word "dot"
      - and few other corrections to the text
02/01/86.mp4:
  1530:
    tts:
      - suppose I am ready to render the trailer
      - exciting!
  2836:
    tts:
      - so the trailer seems to be doing fine
      - let us continue
  3314:
    tts:
      - I need to create the episodes
  2470:
    tts:
      - Add recordings for the first episode

02/01/87.mp4:
02/02/0.mp4:
02/02/1.mp4:
  590:
    tts:
      - what should it look like?
      - an episode
      - with these huge videos
  1052:
    tts:
      - back to the docs
  1801:
    tts:
      - does it sound like I might want to use the offthread video?
  3171:
    tts:
      - maybe
  3888:
    tts:
      - take the same thing as we wrote for the trailer
  4223:
    tts:
      - paste in the episode component
02/02/2.mp4:
  32:
    tts:
      - now fix a few things
  1131:
    tts:
      - one major difference
  1291:
    tts:
      - I will use the video clip here instead of presentation
  1466:
    tts:
      - what should I call it
      - .5

02/02/3.mp4:
  860:
    tts:
      - so get the actual videos in
  1084:
    tts:
      - and I already wrap it in static file here
      - let us get them from public directory then
02/02/4.mp4:
  3856:
    tts:
      - so I need to do get the duration of each clip
02/02/5.mp4:
  478:
    tts:
      - so there is a media util for that
  1115:
    tts:
      - sadly no hook
      - unlike the audio
02/02/6.mp4:
  112:
    tts:
      - I already load the video once
      - can I maybe use the ref and get metadata from it?
02/02/7.mp4:
02/02/8.mp4:
02/02/9.mp4:
  159:
    tts:
      - hell yeah, do like this every day and mama will be proud
  2725:
    tts:
      - sadly it turned out my recording was off for a bit
  2820:
    tts:
      - I made a few changes in the meantime
  2932:
    tts:
      - Trailer is simply rendering slides with the given script
  3219:
    tts:
      - I extracted some utilities
      - which I am still using
  3665:
    tts:
      - as for the episode
      - It should allow for both video clips and slides
02/02/10.mp4:
  64:
    tts:
      - I started with taking care of the difference between these two
  2231:
    tts:
      - ok so here is my sequence from slides
      - some durations for the whole episode is also appearing in the log
  2645:
    tts:
      - add some opening slides

02/02/11.mp4:
02/02/12.mp4:
  2868:
    tts:
      - let us make some adjustments to how it looks
02/02/13.mp4:
  1259:
    tts:
      - so I want it to say things at a certain frame
  3203:
    tts:
      - let us get a little smarter about these props
02/02/14.mp4:
  2725:
    tts:
      - add a speech example to one of the videos
  3126:
    ns: start
    volume: 50
  3271:
    ns: end
    volume: 0
    tts:
      - hmm, why is it doing that?
02/02/15.mp4:
  255:
    tts:
      - could the non-unique key issue cause this?
      - Imagine, it could
02/02/16.mp4:
  0:
    ns: start
    volume: 50
  69:
    ns: end
    volume: 0

  2609:
    ns: start
    volume: 50
  2686:
    ns: end
    volume: 0
    tts:
      - ok, still the API response sounds good
02/02/17.mp4:
02/02/18.mp4:
  574:
    tts:
      - sounds like the audio restarts
      - is it because something is being remounted?
  1498:
    tts:
      - well, try a memo
  2565:
    tts:
      - nope that did not help
  3012:
    tts:
      - I will try and render just a short piece
02/02/19.mp4:
  2326:
    tts:
      - rendered alright
      - in 545 seconds
  3266:
    tts:
      - only that I forgot to add the speech to video clip
02/02/20.mp4:
  3266:

    tts:

  2725:
    tts:
      - just a full size rectangle
      - does not matter now
02/02/35.mp4:
  446:
    tts:
      - accept some blur prop
02/02/36.mp4:
  3203:
    tts:
      - so just map all the blur entries as sequences
      - blur from frame to frame, given the style prop to specify the size and position
02/02/37.mp4:
  1832:
    tts:
      - and just and an example
02/02/38.mp4:
  3968:
    tts:

      - it shows up, but shape is not what I want
02/02/39.mp4:
  1338:
    tts:

  2932:
    tts:

  1912:

      - an svg circle
  2024:
    tts:
      - with r or radius, tho?
02/02/44.mp4:
  351:
    tts:
      - and make it scale up as a video starts
  4063:
    tts:
      - I want it to scale from center
02/02/45.mp4:
  701:
    tts:
      - simply set the transform origin center
  1195:
    tts:
      - add an example

  2645:

      - suppose I want to show the reverse animation at the ending
02/02/58.mp4:

    tts:
      - I need to know the duration of slides here
  1466:
    tts:
      - let us see it
      - 1
  3633:
    tts:
      - and one at the end
      - 1
02/02/59.mp4:
  414:
    tts:
      - make splash duration a constant, I can import
  876:
    tts:
      - in seconds, the number of frames I can compute with FPS
  3346:
    tts:
      - use the FPS for speech duration as well
02/02/60.mp4:
  2119:
    tts:
      - also in seconds
02/02/61.mp4:
02/02/62.mp4:
  2295:
    tts:
      - duration in frames must be an integer
  2518:
    tts:
      - round up here
  4302:
    tts:
      - even better its not a number now
02/02/63.mp4:
  64:
    tts:
      - then let us debug
  1801:
    tts:
      - add a condition
02/02/64.mp4:
  191:
    tts:
      - ah yeah, forgot the FPS
  1354:
    tts:
      - seems better
      - now an SVG attribute error, tho
  1896:
    tts:
      - fix that one too
  3792:
    tts:
      - add an end to the slides sequence
02/02/65.mp4:
  829:
    tts:
      - text to speech should handle pauses
      - I just add them as number values to text to speech arrays
  2741:
    tts:
      - and handle them here
02/03/0.mp4:
  80:
    startFrom: true
    tts:
      - let us add some pauses in our speech
  1801:
    tts:
      - and log the full durations
  3091:
    tts:
      - yeah, and how many times its being rendered?
  3601:
    tts:
      - react is unhappy
      - let us check
02/03/1.mp4:
02/03/2.mp4:
  2183:
    tts:
      - well it is a render per frame
      - which makes sense, I guess
      - still something is off
      - but I can test the ending splash
02/03/3.mp4:
  303:
    tts:
      - okay
      - let us see what comes out
02/03/4.mp4:
  303:
    tts:
      - meanwhile separate the ssml thingy
  2310:
    tts:
      - there is an entire thing for react-ssml-dom
      - nice!
  3251:
    tts:
      - but not for now
  3776:
    tts:
      - an utility function it will be
02/03/5.mp4:
  1291:
    tts:
      - and start using it here in the slides component
  1816:
    tts:
      - as well as the video clip
  3601:
    tts:
      - update the props here as well
02/03/6.mp4:
  574:
    tts:
      - and the examples
  3282:
    tts:
      - Meanwhile the video is ready
      - let us check
  3888:
    tts:
      - well, yes
  3999:
    tts:
      - and also no
02/03/7.mp4:
  1641:
    tts:
      - make some corrections to text as well
02/03/8.mp4:
  3904:
    tts:
      - attempt another render
02/03/9.mp4:
  32:
    tts:
      - also add something for previewing the clips, so that I can note down frame numbers and timings
02/03/10.mp4:
  2836:
    tts:
      - It would help me to see if there is something spoken on that video preview
02/03/11.mp4:
02/03/12.mp4:
02/03/13.mp4:
  2486:
    tts:
      - meanwhile the render of the trailer failed
      - with a time out
02/03/14.mp4:
02/03/15.mp4:
  3410:
    tts:
      - a preview like this
  3856:
    tts:
      - only the video does not fit
02/03/16.mp4:
  1625:
    tts:
      - and I was hoping to see something in the timeline for my "speech indicator" thingy
  2215:
    tts:
      - can I do something custom about the editor timeline?
  3984:
    tts:
      - does not seem so
      - hmm, get things in timeline
02/03/17.mp4:
  1195:
    tts:
      - what I render them upfront?
02/03/18.mp4:

02/03/21.mp4:

  112:
    tts:
      - yeah, I see something
  2980:
    tts:
      - but only that much
      - which suggests its not the way
02/03/23.mp4:
02/03/24.mp4:
  2199:
    tts:
      - hmm, would it help to preload things?
      - so that my render does not timeout
02/03/25.mp4:
  3043:
    tts:
      - did not magically help with the restarting speech, that I know for sure
02/03/26.mp4:
  64:
    tts:
      - just like it says
      - helpful with the player component
  159:
    tts:

  2040:
    tts:
      - well, for the preview I could just render audio
      - it does show up in the timeline with some visualization on it
02/03/32.mp4:
  1976:
    tts:
      - at least it should
  2263:
    tts:
      - ah and it does
      - just took a while to load my audio file
  2868:
    tts:
      - that is enough for preview
